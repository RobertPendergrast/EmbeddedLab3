In the case where the copilation is failing with the huge number of errors, run the tcl scrips from within the gui, then compile from within the gui.

TCL scrips are tools->TCL_scrips->hds_sdram_p0_parameters.tcl and
tools->TCL_scrips->hds_sdram_p0_pin_assignments.tcl 

You can then run the rest of the commands (the make dbt and the like) and they should suceed, though they will still take a while and look like they are recompiling everything.
